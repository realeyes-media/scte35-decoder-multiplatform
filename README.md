# SCTE-35

SCTE-35 is the standard for time-based event messaging in video streams. It's most commonly used for dynamically signaling when to insert an ad break, but it could also contain information about program boundaries, blackouts, or stream switching.

## Multiplatform SCTE-35 Decoder

This is the RealEyes Kotlin Multiplatform project for SCTE-35 parsing.

### Project Setup
